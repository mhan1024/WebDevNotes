## ⚛️ Frontend
Frameworks help split web applications into components, manage data and state, and update the UI automatically when data changes. \
Popular frameworks include: [Angular](###Angular), [React](###React), [Vue](###Vue), and [Next](###Next)

### 🛡️ Angular
  <ul>
    <li>A full framework, meaning that all the tools/components are provided to build a web application.</li>
    <li>You won't need other libraries for routing, forms, HTTP requests, or state management.</li>
    <li>Uses TypeScript*</li>
  </ul>
  
### 💙 React
  <ul>
    <li>A UI library rather than a framework that allows you to write HTML inside JavaScript (JSX).</li>
    <li>React only handles the UI layer and you'll need to install third-party libraries for routing, forms, HTTP requests, and state management.</li>
  </ul>


### ✅ Vue
  <ul>
    <li>A mix between Angular and React that uses HTML-based templates and reactive data binding.</li>
    <li>Vue is also called a "progressive framework" because you can start small with a single component and scale up as needed.</li>
  </ul>
  
[Vue Cheatsheet](./Vue.md)

### 🚀 Next.js
  <ul>
    <li>A React-based framework that includes the tools/components needed to build a web application.</li>
    <li>Pages are rendered on the server to allow for faster performance.</li>
    <li>API routes are built-in and you can create backend endpoints inside the frontend project.</li>
  </ul>
